    "newsContent": "Physical fitness is a state of health and well-being and, more specifically, the ability to perform aspects of sports, occupations and daily activities. Physical fitness is generally achieved through proper nutrition,[1] moderate-vigorous physical exercise,[2] and sufficient rest along with a formal recovery plan.[3]Before the Industrial Revolution, fitness was defined as the capacity to carry out the day's activities without undue fatigue or lethargy. However, with automation and changes in lifestyles, physical fitness is now considered a measure of the body's ability to function efficiently and effectively in work and leisure activities, to be healthy, to resist hypokinetic diseases, improve immune system and to meet emergency situations.[4]Fitness is defined as the quality or state of being fit and healthy.[5] Around 1950, perhaps consistent with the Industrial Revolution and the treatise of World War II, the term fitnessincreased in western vernacular by a factor of ten.[6] The modern definition of fitness describes either a person or machine's ability to perform a specific function or a holistic definition of human adaptability to cope with various situations. This has led to an interrelation of human fitness and physical attractiveness that has mobilized global fitness and fitness equipment industries. Regarding specific function, fitness is attributed to persons who possess significant aerobic or anaerobic ability (i.e., endurance or strength). A well-rounded fitness program improves a person in all aspects of fitness compared to practicing only one, such as only cardio/respiratory or only weight training.A comprehensive fitness program tailored to an individual typically focuses on one or more specific skills,[7] and on age-[8] or health-related needs such as bone health.[9] Many sources[10] also cite mental, social and emotional health as an important part of overall fitness. This is often presented in textbooks as a triangle made up of three points, which represent physical, emotional, and mental fitness. Physical fitness has been shown to have benefits in preventing ill health and assisting recovery from injury or illness. Along with the physical health benefits of fitness, it has also been shown to have a positive impact on mental health as well by assisting in treating anxiety and depression.[11] Physical fitness can also prevent or treat many other chronic health conditions brought on by unhealthy lifestyle or aging as well and has been listed frequently as one of the most popular and advantageous self-care therapies.[12] Working out can also help some people sleep better by building up sleeping pressure and possibly alleviate some mood disorders in certain individuals.[13]Developing research has demonstrated that many of the benefits of exercise are mediated through the role of skeletal muscle as an endocrine organ. That is, contracting muscles release multiple substances known as myokines, which promote the growth of new tissue, tissue repair, and various anti-inflammatory functions, which in turn reduce the risk of developing various inflammatory diseases.[14]",

    "title": "Integrated Role of Nutrition and Physical Activity for Lifelong Health",
    "authorName": "John Doe",
    "newsContent": "It is well established that healthy nutrition and physical activity (PA) are key lifestyle factors that modulate lifelong health through their ability to improve body composition, musculoskeletal health, and physical and cognitive performance, as well as to prevent metabolic diseases including obesity, diabetes mellitus, and cardiovascular disease across the lifespan. While the health benefits of nutrition and PA are often studied singularly, it has become more and more evident that the integration of nutrition and PA has the potential to produce greater benefits when compared to strategies focusing solely on one or the other. This Special Issue entitled “Integrated Role of Nutrition and Physical Activity for Lifelong Health” is devoted to manuscripts that highlight this integrational approach on various outcomes related to lifelong health. In response to our call, a total of 14 manuscripts were included. In addition to research focusing on the integrated benefits of nutrition and PA on various markers related to health and performance across a broad spectrum of life stages, several studies examining how PA has the potential to change food consumption were also included.The featured article by Gustafson et al. reports that food choices are altered in the context of exercise. In this experiment, gym goers were asked to choose between a healthy and unhealthy snack to be consumed after completion of their exercise. Compared to when this choice was made prior to exercise, individuals after completing exercise were less likely to choose a healthy snack and instead chose the unhealthy option [1]. This possibly unhealthy impact of sport participation on food choices was extended in another study by Koenigstorfer, although participation was limited to passive viewership in this instance. Regardless, visits to sporting events were associated with an increased preference for unhealthy food items, although it was notable that a similar increase was also observed for some non-sport related venues, such as music concerts [2]. In a study focusing on the health effects of dietary choices in the context of an exercising population, Wirnizter et al. report that vegetarian and vegan athletes exhibited lower body weights and vegetarian athletes reported a lower prevalence of allergies when compared to their omnivore counterparts, while many other health-related outcomes were similar. These findings suggest that adherence to a vegetarian or even vegan diet is not detrimental to the health of endurance athletes [3].",

    "title": "Health Benefits of Exercise",
    "authorName": "John Doe",
    "newsContent": "Overwhelming evidence exists that lifelong exercise is associated with a longer health span, delaying the onset of 40 chronic conditions/diseases. What is beginning to be learned is the molecular mechanisms by which exercise sustains and improves quality of life. The current review begins with two short considerations. The first short presentation concerns the effects of endurance exercise training on cardiovascular fitness, and how it relates to improved health outcomes. The second short section contemplates emerging molecular connections from endurance training to mental health. Finally, approximately half of the remaining review concentrates on the relationships between type 2 diabetes, mitochondria, and endurance training. It is now clear that physical training is complex biology, invoking polygenic interactions within cells, tissues/organs, systems, with remarkable cross talk occurring among the former list.The aim of this introduction is briefly to document facts that health benefits of physical activity predate its readers. In the 5th century BC, the ancient physician Hippocrates stated: “All parts of the body, if used in moderation and exercised in labors to which each is accustomed, become thereby healthy and well developed and age slowly; but if they are unused and left idle, they become liable to disease, defective in growth and age quickly.” However, by the 21st century, the belief in the value of exercise for health has faded so considerably, the lack of exercise now presents a major public health problem (Fig. 1) (Booth et al. 2012). Similarly, the lack of exercise was classified as an actual cause of chronic diseases and death (Mokdad et al. 2004).",
